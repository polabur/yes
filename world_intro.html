            <p>Story is a game element where story entries featuring certain partner characters can be unlocked and read. Prior to mobile v2.0.0, story snippets could only be read from song select via certain songs.<br>

                Arcaea's story is bundled with certain song packs.<br>
                You can see what pack you'll need for a specific story by tapping on it.<br>
                To progress through the story, you will need to complete requirements.<br>
                You may complete these requirements on any difficulty level.<br>
                You can come back any time to reread story entries you've already unlocked.<br>
                <br>
                The Main Story, Side Stories, and Short Stories are divided into various numbered paths, each focused on a Partner, given in the infobox above. Paths are themselves divided into entries, which follow a Path-Entry numbering scheme. Each entry becomes highlighted when its prerequisites are met, and fully unlocked and readable after completing its Story Challenge. Story Challenges generally require a particular songs to be played with a particular partner.<br>
                <br>
                The Arcaea prologue story is free to unlock and read. Prerequisites and requirements for other Main Stories and Side Stories involve purchasing the relevant song pack and unlocking its associated partner/s, while Short Stories typically only require purchasing one or two of the partner's associated songs. Some stories have additional requirements involving additional songs or other partners' stories.<br>
